<p>If you’ve ever taken a long flight, you know the struggle. Trying to fit only the bare essentials into your carry on, while still predicting what you’ll need for the next 6+ hours. Well, we’re here to help. After many, many long-haul flights, we think we’ve finally figured it out.</p>

<h6>Neck Pillow</h6>
<p>I thought my life was fine before I found a good neck pillow, but I was wrong. After finding the <a href="https://www.cabeau.com/products/evolution-travel-neck-pillow/">Evolution Pillow</a>, I know better. This pillow is perfect. It’s made of memory foam, allowing it to be soft enough to cuddle with but firm enough to offer support. It’s also the perfect shape, high on sides and slim on the back, so your head can relax rather than be pushed forward. It also clasps in the front for additional support. You can buy this baby online or at most airport retailers. Easy.</p>

<h6>Eye Mask</h6>
<p>Yes, most airlines do offer free eye masks for longhaul flights. No, I do not recommend using them. Their backing is made with elastic, causing them to pull on and irritate your eyes. And, they’re flimsy and tend to let light in. On my most recent flight to Melbourne, I purchased a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PLEMO-Sleep-Therapy-Insomnia-Circles/dp/B01A51KQQ6/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1484526646&sr=8-4&keywords=gel+eye+mask+sleep">gel eye mask</a> at the airport that has solved all my eye mask woes. It has a silky covering, which soothes my eyes, but has a gel inside that helps prevent the infamous bags we all get under our eyes after a long-haul flight.</p>

<h6>Pashmina/Scarf</h6>
<p>Years ago I bought a cheap, oversized, black scarf and it’s still one of my favorite purchases. Not only does it help make a look seems slightly more put together, but it also acts as a light blanket in times of need. For me, it’s the perfect airline blanket. <a href="http://www.hm.com/us/product/37545?article=37545-C">This</a> one is similar to what I have but if you’re looking for something a little nicer try <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/nordstrom-collection-oversize-cashmere-wrap/4350222?origin=category-personalizedsort&fashioncolor=BLACK">this</a>.</p>

<h6>Change of Clothes</h6>
<p>I’ve heard too many horror stories about lost luggage to chance a day of vacation. Now, I always pack one simple outfit that I can use as a change of clothes in case my bag gets lost. If I’m going tropical and beach time is a big part of my plan, I pack a bathing suit as well.</p>

<h6>Fuzzy Socks</h6>
<p>Wearing shoes for a long flight sucks and going barefoot isn’t very appealing to those around you. So, I’ve started packing a durable pair of fuzzy socks. These make the flight far more enjoyable (for everyone) but also makes me feel slightly more luxurious than typical ankle socks.</p>

<h6>Snack Pack</h6>
<p>For me, my snack stash isn’t for while I’m on a long flight, normally they offer enough snacks to keep me occupied. This is for those times that you’re delayed and end up having to sprint to your next gate, thus missing a meal. Packing a granola bar or two helps when you’re battling hanger and don’t have time to stop to eat.</p>

<h6>Mini Toiletry Kit</h6>
<p>Two reasons: lost luggage and in-flight fixes. I always have [face wash cloths] to do a quick cleanse before sleeping, face lotion (this one smells like lavendar which is great for relaxation), tooth brush, tooth paste, dry shampoo and my makeup essentials. This way, I can feel fresh the entire flight and am not in a bind if my luggage gets lost.</p>

<h6>Hand Lotion</h6>
<p>Nothing bothers me more than when my hands are dry. I always carry a small hand lotion around to prevent that from happening. Whenever I’m at a hotel, I swipe the room lotion, so I always have a travel-size bottle.</p>

<h6>Lip Balm</h6>
<p>Once again, planes dry you out! Having a good chapstick can help prevent dry, cracking lips. I recently fell in love with this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yes-Coconut-Cooling-Lip-Ounce/dp/B00N57OO48/ref=sr_1_11_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1484527458&sr=8-11&keywords=coconut+lip+balm">coconut gel</a> from Yes to Coconut. Thank you, Amazon Prime.</p>

<h6>Book/Laptop/Entertainment</h6>
<p>Long flights can be boring. Having your laptop is great if you’re trying to get some work done, but sometimes I enjoy the “sorry I don’t have wifi” life. Books are great because they allow you to truly by disconnected.</p>

<h6>Portable Charger</h6>
<p>Nothing is worse than landing and not having any battery life on your phone. I always carry around a portable charger so I’m never stranded. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Portable-Power-Bank-000/dp/B00LRK8JDC">This</a> basic one from Amazon does the job and is only $20.</p>

<h6>Water Bottle</h6>
<p>If you’re always thirsty (like me), bringing an empty water bottle can be a life saver. Flight attendants are normally more than happy to fill you up, allowing you to not have to flag them down every time your water is empty. Also, a lot of airports are installing water bottle stations, allowing you to do some good by buying fewer plastic bottles. I like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vapur-Outdoor-Shades-Bottle-0-5-Liter/dp/B00BKOLSME/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1484528126&sr=8-4&keywords=packable+water+bottle">this</a> one as it is super small when empty and is easy to pack.</p>
