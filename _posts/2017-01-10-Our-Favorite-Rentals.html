Travelers crave more. So, we took the liberty of finding our favorite short-term rentals out there so you don’t have to.</p>

Walla Walla Wine Barrel
Walla Walla, WA
For those of you that really want to immerse yourself in a wine-tasting adventure, this is the place for you. After a day of wine tasting in Walla Walla, dive into the experience by sleeping in an oversized wine barrel. Or you could stay in the house, but the barrel just sounds more fun.
St Pacras Clock Tower
London, UK
If you’ve been dying to stay in a clock tower but can’t forego modern conveniences, this is the place for you. Located in the heart of London, you can look out over Kings Cross Station practicing all of your favorite hunchback of Notre Dame impressions. Best of all, this tower doesn’t ring, so you don’t have to worry about waking up every hour, on the hour.
The Seashell House
