<h1>Our Favorite Rentals</h1>

It’s all about the accommodation. Now, more than ever, we rely on visuals before we make travel plans, meaning that cookie cutter hotels and basic rooms are no longer good enough. Travelers crave more. So, we took the liberty of finding our favorite short-term rentals out there so you don’t have to.

Oheka Castle
Long Island, NY
For all of you who want to have your own “Blank Space” moment, you can rent out Oheka Castle for a mere $348/night. Whether you want to throw burning clothes off the balcony or walk greyhounds in the courtyard, this castle is where T-Swift filmed the iconic music video herself.
Walla Walla Wine Barrel
Walla Walla, WA
For those of you that really want to immerse yourself in a wine-tasting adventure, this is the place for you. After a day of wine tasting in Walla Walla, dive into the experience by sleeping in an oversized wine barrel. Or you could stay in the house, but the barrel just sounds more fun.
St Pacras Clock Tower
London, UK
If you’ve been dying to stay in a clock tower but can’t forego modern conveniences, this is the place for you. Located in the heart of London, you can look out over Kings Cross Station practicing all of your favorite hunchback of Notre Dame impressions. Best of all, this tower doesn’t ring, so you don’t have to worry about waking up every hour, on the hour.
The Seashell House
Isla Mujeres, Mexico
Selling seashells by the sea shore might not be the most appealing option, but sleeping in a seashell themed house certainly is. Complete with a pool, ocean views and all the seashells your heart could possibly desire, this house will make all your mermaid dreams come true.
Still Bend by Frank Lloyd Wright
Two Rivers, WI
If staying in a house designed by a famous architect suits your fancy, this is the place for you. Modeled after Frank Lloyd Wright’s Dream House featured in Life Magazine in 1938, this house is sure to impress. From the windows designed to create light shows on the walls to the bookshelves full of classic novels, this is the perfect place to slow down and relax.
Bamboo House
Bali, Indonesia
Does staying in a gorgeous, open air, bamboo house in the middle of Bali sound appealing to you? If so, this is the place for you. Complete with panoramic views of the Ayung river gorge and a natural pool, this is the perfect Balinese escape.
Elqui Domos
Coquimbo, Chile
The only astronomic hotel in the southern hemisphere, Elqui Domos is sure to give you a unique experience. Spend your day exploring the vineyards of Elqui Valley, and your night soaking in the beautiful skies. Each dome has a detachable roof, allowing you to fall asleep to the sight of shooting stars.
